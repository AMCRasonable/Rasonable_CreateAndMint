# ERC20 Token

## Overview
This smart contract creates an ERC20 token named AnaToken (symbol: AT). The contract allows the following functionalities:

1. Minting: Only the owner can mint new tokens to any address.
2. Burning: Any user can burn (destroy) their own tokens.
3. Transferring: Any user can transfer tokens to other addresses.

## Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code to the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the compile button.
